The solution involves using a more robust and optimized image handling approach.  This may involve using a library to manage memory efficiently, pre-processing images before sending them to the app, or choosing a different approach to image selection entirely.

Here's an example using asynchronous operations and error handling:

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

async function pickMultipleImages() {
  let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsEditing: true,
    selectionLimit: 10, // Adjust as needed
  });

  if (!result.cancelled) {
    // Process the selected images asynchronously
    const processedImages = await Promise.all(result.assets.map(async (asset) => {
      try {
        // Perform any necessary image processing here (e.g., resize, compression)
        // ...
        return { uri: asset.uri, ... }; // Return processed image data
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing image:', error);
        return null; // Handle processing errors
      }
    }));

    // Use the processed images
    console.log('Processed images:', processedImages.filter(img => img !== null));
  }
}
```
This revised approach addresses potential memory issues, error handling, and offers improved reliability when picking multiple images. Always test thoroughly on various devices and platforms.
